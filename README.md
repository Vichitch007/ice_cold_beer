# Ice Cold Beer
Repository for intro to game dev project 1
## The game that will be made will be inspired by the arcade game "Ice Cold Beer" where the objective is to get the ball from the bottom of the machine to the top while avoiding the holes that the ball can fall through. The player controls the platform the ball is on and can tilt it to roll the ball back and forth to avoid the holes.
